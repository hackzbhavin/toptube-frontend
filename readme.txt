**Project Summary: YouTube Channel Insights**

This project aims to provide users with valuable insights into the performance of a YouTube channel. Users can input a YouTube video link from a specific channel, and the system will generate a comprehensive result page showcasing the top three performing videos for that channel. The ranking is based on the Earning Potential formula, which takes into account engagement metrics such as subscriber count, likes, comments, and views.

**Key Features:**

1. **Landing Page:**
   - Users can input a YouTube video link from the desired channel.
   - Initiate the analysis process to gather insights.

2. **Progress Loader:**
   - A dynamic loader indicates the progress of the analysis from 0% to 100%.

3. **Result Page:**
   - Users are redirected to a detailed result page after inputting the video link.
   - The page displays engagement metrics for the provided video.
   - Calculated earnings based on the Earning Potential formula.
   - Rank of the video among the top three performing videos of the channel.

**Technology Stack:**
- MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) for full-stack development.
- Utilizes the YouTube Video API to fetch data dynamically.

**How to Run:**
1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up the MERN stack locally.
3. Provide API keys for YouTube Video API.
4. Run the development server.

**Note:**
- The project assumes a MERN stack setup, and it's crucial to configure API keys for accessing YouTube data.
- The loader provides real-time feedback on the progress of data analysis.
- Result page presents a clear overview of video metrics, earnings, and rank among top-performing videos.

This project aims to offer a user-friendly interface for exploring YouTube channel analytics, making it a valuable tool for content creators and enthusiasts alike.
